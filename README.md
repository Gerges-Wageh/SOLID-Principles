# SOLID Principles in Practice

## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects that illustrate the application of the SOLID principles in software development. Each project demonstrates how to apply a specific SOLID principle to enhance code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Projects

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Project 1**: Invoice Generator app. A simple project to handle shopping cart and generate invoice.
  


### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Project 1**: Bonus Calculator app. A simple app to calculate the employee over time hours bonus. 
- **Project 2**: Shape Drawer app. A simple app to draw different shapes.
- **Project 3**: Quiz Generator app. A simple app generates different types of questions.


### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Project 1**: Accounts Management app. A simple app handles differnet types of banking accounts.
- **Project 2**: Posts Management app. A simple app handles different types of social platform posts.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Project 1**: Employees Entitlement. A simple app handles the entitlement of different types of employees.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Project 1**: Notification Service. A simple app sends notifications via different emailing facilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gerges-Wageh/SOLID-Principles.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd solid-principles
    ```
3. Follow the instructions in the individual project directories to build and run the code.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
